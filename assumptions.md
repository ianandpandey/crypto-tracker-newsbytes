# Assumptions

1. Free API with no auth preferred, so we used **CoinGecko** instead of CoinMarketCap.
2. App is assumed to be responsive and used primarily on mobile/tablet.
3. Only **top 20 coins** shown for simplicity and performance.
4. Converter dropdown shows top 100 coins only to limit API load.
5. Live price conversions are based on current USD price fetched via API.
